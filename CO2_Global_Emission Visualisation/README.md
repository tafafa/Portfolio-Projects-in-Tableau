# 🌍 Visualizing Global CO₂ Emissions with Tableau

This project provides an interactive Tableau visualization of global CO₂ emissions, exploring trends across different countries and populations.  

## 📊 Visualizations Included:

1. **CO₂ Emissions by Country** – Total CO₂ emissions for each country.
2. **CO₂ Emissions (2021) vs. Population** – A comparative analysis of emissions against population size.
3. **CO₂ Global Share Over Time** – How each country's share of global emissions has changed over the years.

## 📂 Files in This Repository
